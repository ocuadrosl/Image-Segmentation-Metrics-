This project aims to implement object-oriented measures to quantitatively compare segmentation files (.seg). Currently, there are three implemented measures: 

1) Alberlaez Error Measure (AEM), Arbelaez et. al. (2009)

2) Object-level Consistency Error (OCE), Polak et. al. (2009) 

3) An Adjustable Object-oriented Error Measure for Image Segmentation Evaluation (AOM), Oscar Cuadros Linares et. al. (2015): This error measure outperforms both AEM and OCE measures, not only in terms of accuracy but also in time processing. Besides, AOM satisfies the three axioms of metric spaces.        

Usage:

Those metrics are implemented in C++, you just should include the header file "metric.h" in your own project. Moreover, we implemented a class to read and write SEG files and a class to measure the processing time. See the example below:


#include "metric.h"


int main()
{
	
	SEG seg1, seg2;
	seg1.read("segmentation1.seg");
	seg2.read("segmentation2.seg");

	AOM aom;
	aom.setPenality(0.5);
	Jaccard jaccard;
	Dice dice;

	std::cout << aom.compute(seg1, seg2) << std::endl;
	std::cout << jaccard.compute(seg1, seg2) << std::endl;
	std::cout << dice.compute(seg1, seg2) << std::endl;
	
	return 0;
}
